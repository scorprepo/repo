Ray's meddling parents, Frank and Marie, live directly across the street and embrace the motto \"Su casa es mi casa,\" infiltrating their son's home to an extent unparalleled in television history. Frank's favorite expression, \"Holy Crap,\" is shouted at regular intervals, and Marie's \"cooking advice\" is less than appreciated by Debra. Brother Robert, a divorced policeman, is constantly moving in and out of his parents' house, and loves to drop over and resent Ray's successful career and happy family life. Ray and Debra just wish someone would knock once in a while. Finalizing it's 9th and final season, the cast and crew of \"ELR\" has had a very successful run, and it makes it even harder for them all to say good-bye.",
